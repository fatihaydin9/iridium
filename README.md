## 1. What Is Iridium Web?
Iridium Web is an advanced software infrastructure that I developed, leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies such as Domain Driven Design, Clean Architecture, CQRS, Containerization. I designed it with a monolithic architecture that incorporates a range of sophisticated functionalities including extensive logging, a advanced role management system, caching solutions, robust security features for authentication and authorization, and seamless integration of data layers.

### 1.1. DDD (omain Driven Design)
I implemented Domain Driven Design in Iridium Web to ensure that the development process aligns closely with the complex and evolving business needs of modern enterprises. This approach fosters a common language between myself, other developers, and business stakeholders, significantly enhancing our communication and understanding. It simplifies maintenance by organizing the system into distinct bounded contexts, each crafted to address specific segments of business complexity. Moreover, DDD ensures that the architecture evolves in concert with business strategies, enabling smooth adaptability to new demands.

### 1.2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
In Iridium Web, I integrated the CQRS pattern, which is crucial as application complexities increase. This pattern separates data operations into distinct command (write) and query (read) actions, thus enhancing performance and scalability. It also bolsters security by isolating sensitive operations and allows me to tailor technologies and database schemas specifically optimized for each side's functions.

### 1.3. MediatR and the Mediator Pattern
I chose MediatR, a well-known .NET library that implements the mediator pattern, to simplify communication by reducing the direct dependencies among components. By decoupling the applicationâ€™s components, MediatR allows them to operate more independently, communicating through a central mediator. This reduces component interdependency, enhancing both maintainability and scalability. It also helps adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by managing distinct logic through discrete handlers, each dedicated to a specific type of command or query. 

### 2. Features Overview

#### 2.1. Entity Change Tracker & Standard Fields
In Iridium Web, I integrated an Entity Change Tracker that meticulously logs every modification, capturing detailed snapshots of entities before and after any changes. This feature is vital for ensuring compliance and facilitating debugging. The system also automatically manages standard fields like `CreatedBy`, `CreatedDate`, `ModifiedBy`, and `ModifiedDate`, crucial for maintaining data accountability and integrity.

#### 2.2. Role System
At startup, I ensure Iridium Web synchronizes predefined roles from the codebase to the database using a code-first migration strategy. This minimizes manual intervention and enhances security by regulating access based on well-defined parent-child roles. 

#### 2.3. Authentication & Authorization
I uphold security within Iridium Web through the use of JWT Bearer Tokens, which are securely signed with symmetric keys. This robust authentication is supported by a dynamic role-based access control system, ensuring all actions within the application strictly adhere to established security policies.

#### 2.4. Fluent Validation System
To maintain data integrity and simplify the validation process, I use the FluentValidation library in Iridium Web. This allows me to define clear and comprehensive validation rules, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

#### 2.5. AutoMapper Integration
I have integrated AutoMapper into Iridium Web to streamline the mapping of data between objects, significantly reducing the need for manual coding. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with complex data structures and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), ensuring a clean separation between data layers and business logic, which enhances both maintainability and scalability.
