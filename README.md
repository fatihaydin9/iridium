## 1. What Is Iridium Web?
Iridium Web is an advanced software framework I designed, leveraging cutting-edge methodologies such as Domain Driven Design, Clean Architecture, CQRS, Containerization, and utilizing AutoMapper for efficient object mapping. It employs a monolithic architecture that supports a wide array of sophisticated functionalities including extensive logging mechanisms, a comprehensive role management system, advanced caching solutions, robust security features for authentication and authorization, and seamless data transfer between layers.

### 1.1. Domain Driven Design (DDD)
In Iridium Web, I implement Domain Driven Design to align the software development process with the intricate business needs of modern enterprises. This approach fosters a common vocabulary between developers and business stakeholders, enhancing communication and mutual understanding. It simplifies maintenance by segregating the system into well-defined bounded contexts, each tailored to handle specific aspects of business complexity. Moreover, DDD ensures that the software architecture remains closely aligned with evolving business strategies, thereby facilitating seamless adaptability to change.

### 1.2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
The CQRS pattern is integral to Iridium Web, especially as application complexities escalate. By delineating data operations into distinct command and query actions, CQRS elevates performance and scalability. It enhances security through the isolation of sensitive operations and allows for the tailored selection of technologies and database schemas on the command and query sides, optimizing each for their specific roles.

### 2. Features Overview

#### 2.1. Entity Change Tracker & Standard Fields
Iridium Web incorporates a sophisticated Entity Change Tracker that logs every modification, providing snapshots of entities before and after changes. This is indispensable for compliance and debugging. The framework also automates the management of standard fields such as `CreatedBy`, `CreatedDate`, `ModifiedBy`, and `ModifiedDate`, which play crucial roles in maintaining data accountability and integrity.

#### 2.2. Role System
At startup, Iridium Web synchronizes predefined roles from the codebase to the database using a code-first migration strategy, ensuring role definitions are always synchronized with the latest system version. This automation reduces manual overhead and enhances system security by precisely controlling access based on user roles.

#### 2.3. Authentication & Authorization
Security in Iridium Web is managed through the use of JWT Bearer Tokens, signed with symmetric keys to ensure integrity and authenticity. Coupled with a dynamic role-based access control system, this ensures that all actions within the application are securely authorized in line with established policies.

#### 2.4. Fluent Validation System
To maintain the integrity and accuracy of data, Iridium Web uses the FluentValidation library. This allows for the definition of complex validation rules through a clean and expressive interface, which enhances the readability and maintainability of the validation logic.

#### 2.5. AutoMapper Integration
AutoMapper is integrated into Iridium Web to streamline object-to-object mapping, reducing the need for manual coding of assignment between model objects. This tool significantly speeds up development time and reduces errors by automating the mapping process, especially useful when dealing with complex data structures and DTOs. AutoMapper ensures that our data layer objects are cleanly separated from business logic models, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the application.
